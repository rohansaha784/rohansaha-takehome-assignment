# Loan Approval Workflow (Take-Home)

## Goal
Implement a DAML smart-contract workflow with:
* `LoanRequest`   – borrower asks for a loan.
* `Loan`          – created once the bank approves.

## Roadmap (checked as we go)
- [ ] Scaffold project from `daml new skeleton`
- [ ] Implement templates
- [ ] Happy-path unit test
- [ ] Negative-path unit test (double approval fails)
- [ ] Clean up warnings
- [ ] Finalise docs
